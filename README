hbase-etl is a handful tool to transform and load data from hbase to hbase. This tool is originally built to help medo LSI on wikipedia articles.This program is built on MapReduce paradigm.

1. Prerequisite
	- hadoop0-20-*, hbase 0-20-6
	- library:java-getopt, log4j
2. Compile
	- You can compile using ant,mvn
3. Build
	-
4. Run
	- hadoop jar $jarfile com.vung.processor.TextProcessingJobs -t $inputtable -i $inputcolumn -o $outputcolumn -p $processorclass -m $methodname 

5. Examples
	Transform and load data is a very common task. In stead of writing a lot of MapRreduce codeover times you can reuse my code base to load your business-logic class and run it on your cluster. This tool is generic enough to cover some the common use cases. 
	- $jarfile: is the jar file of this tool.
	- $inputtable: input table name in hbase.
	- $inputcolumn: input column  (family:qualifer) in hbase table.
	- $outputcolumn: output column
	- $processorclass: your own java class
	- $methodname: your method name

Another way to look at it is using SQL, the similar task  in SQL would look like: update $inputtable set $outputcolumn=$method($inputcolumn)

This tool comes with other handful and generic classes. I will update this file.
